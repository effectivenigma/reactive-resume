# REACTIVE-RESUME

A theme-based dynamic resume generator for stlying resumes fast and trouble-free. There is a GUI for data-entry so that users without a technical background can take full advantage of all the possibilities without needing to learn how to build-run-edit software.

Users can now spend more time focusing on the content of their resume to get that dream job and less time worrying about whether the resume will stand out on paper, computer, tablets, etc etc etc.

## Motivation

Project inspired by the frequent need to update resumes. Furthermore there is an increasing need to create resumes that look visually appealing on multiple platforms/form-factors, screen/paper sizes (in fact, just about anything needs to look good on everything) . This tool helps quickly generate resumes with different look-and-feel, compatible with different screen sizes and for printing. 

The project originally started as a [CLI](https://github.com/effectivenigma/experiments/tree/master/resume-cli), using a different set of technologies. Directions were quickly changed to make the software available to a wider audience.

## Technologies
* NodeJS
* ExpressJS
* ReactJS
* Stylus
* Gulp
* Bootstrap (modified css included in build/bootstrap; js not used)

## Coming Soon
* Webpage running this app
* Import data from a properly-formatted JSON file (as an alternative to GUI data-entry)
* More themes
* ...and a whole lot more (surprises for now)

## License
TBD

Until then - copyrighted.
